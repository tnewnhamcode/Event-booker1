Event booking webpage. 
I used the Django framework to make this app. It is not quite yet complete but the essential parts are in place. 
I also used bootstrap for the navbar.
Please note that the comments on each file are for me, I wrote them to help myself learn or to remind me to do something, so no need to worry about them.
It is an app for getting fake tickets to fake events that I made up for demonstrative purposes (to show off my code).
